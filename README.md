French Full-Stack Software Engineer always hungry to open my horizon and keep on learning.

After spending the last 5 years at [Third Bridge](https://thirdbridge.com/) as a Principal Software Engineer and Team Leader, I'm leaving the United Kingdom to go on a solo trip for few months in South East Asia following the ["One bag" philosophy](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/).

 - 📍 __From:__ Rennes, France 🇫🇷
 - 🗣️ __Languages spoken:__ French, English, Spanish (learning)
 - ✉️ __How to reach me:__ Probably worth contacting me directly on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marwan-el-boussarghini)
 - ✨ __Fun fact about me:__ I've spent about a year and half completely remote, living in Mauritius island.


## Work philosophy

After 10 years of professional experience and few years as a Team Leaders, here are a couple of values I thrive for:

 - 🎯 Be Product driven
 - 👨‍💻 Give ownership to Software Engineers
 - 🔧 Be close to the platform and limit usage of third parties
 - 📦 Domain driven architecture


## Technologies

I've spent the last 5 years perfecting my TypeScript and Javascript skills, learning about functional programming and improving my Software Architecture skills.

Here is a glimpse of technologies I've worked with in the last couple of years:
